## ‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication and Traffic Flow**

- All requests to this backend **must pass through an API Gateway**.
- The API Gateway is responsible for **validating the JWT token**.
- Upon validation, the Gateway **attaches `x-user-id`** as a request header.
- **No traffic can reach this service directly** without going through the API Gateway.

This allows the backend to trust the `x-user-id` header for identifying users.
